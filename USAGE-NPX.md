## Scaffold a new project with npx

You can publish this package to npm as `create-nativewind-app`.

After publishing, users can scaffold a new project with:

```bash
npx create-nativewind-app my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run android   # or npm run ios
```

This will copy the boilerplate, re-init git, and set up a fresh project directory.

---

If you update the template, just publish a new version to npm!
